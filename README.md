#url_parse.sh
This script helps my friend with his bachlor thesis.
It's a very simple web crawler written in bash.

#pdf_parse_and_keyword_count.py
I write this script to help my friend with her master thesis. This script gets the keyword frequency from 10,000+ financial reports. This is my first trial to write pdf parser and package it into an executable file.
